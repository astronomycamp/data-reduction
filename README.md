# data-reduction

here we will put in data reduction scripts for basic functions for astronomy. Aiden has written a basic code to take 4 images that have been combined and calibrated and made into a LRGB image.

these can be great codes to give a quick result the campers can compare to to see what their images or data can look like as a guide. they can then be related to tutorials in a separate repository that can walk them through the full process and the math involved.

it's also good for those of us that do not know what to do but can look at the process quickly and teach campers what to do.
